# webdevelopmentanddesign-task3-ak-temperature-converter
This project is a simple temperature converter created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to convert temperature values between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin.  The main goal of this project is to understand how form elements, styling, and basic JavaScript logic work together in a web page.
